## My process

- I started by understanding the challenges pre-requisites and analysing which assets I had available.
- Then I proceeded to outline the HTML structure in order to create a cohesive hierarchy of components.
- Finally I worked on the styling, first I centered and aligned items, then colored them and made any final adjustments.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I was able to exercise intializing a basic HTML page, specially on importing fonts.
```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Outfit:wght@400;700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

I also learned how to reset a page's layout in order to have a clean canvas when styling.

```css
* {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
    font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
}
```

I was also able to exercise CSS Flexbox styling

```css
display: flex; 
align-items: center;
justify-content: center ;
```
